# TI-CC3220S-Thermostat-Project
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project took a Ti CC3220S simple link microcontroller and turned it into a thermostat. In the future add-ons will be completed to enable this thermostat to communicate with a server over the internet. This project solved the problem of not having an accurate thermostat. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I built my state machine and task scheduler programs very well. The board was malfunctioning and would not connect to my computer so I was unable to debug the program.

Where could you improve?
  I believe I could improve the timer and I2C aspect of the program and maybe even add another sensor to the board to allow for added functionality.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The Texas Instruments Message Boards as well as the Resource Explorer in Code Composer Studio

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The implementation of drivers I believe will be very useful for other embedded system projects and even for programs that are based on the PC but connect to peripheral devices. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project is maintainable, readable and adaptable due to its modular nature of the state machine, timer, and task scheduler. Features and functionalities can easily be added to this program by simply adding the driver code and adding another state case and task to the program.
